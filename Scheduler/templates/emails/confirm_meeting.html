Hello {{name}}, 

I just wanted to confirm with you about our scheduled meeting. If you need to reschedule for any reason, that's totally fine! I'm very flexible, and often need to reschedule too. Just reply to this email and let me know so that I can free up the time for someone else.

For this meeting, we can use my <a href="tinyurl.com/Gavin-Zoom">Zoom room.</a> Or send me a link if you want to meet somewhere else.

EST: {{est}}
PST: {{pst}}
UTC: {{utc}}

Sincerely,
Gavin Ray
